# Kaggle Titanic Project

This project is a solution to the [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `kaggle.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook with data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.
- `input/` — Folder containing the original Titanic datasets (`train.csv`, `test.csv`).
- `output/` — (Optional) Folder for saving predictions/submissions.
- `.gitignore` — Files and folders to be ignored by git.

## Features & Approach

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (e.g., Title extraction, Family size, Fare per person)
- Outlier handling and feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the Titanic datasets from Kaggle and place them in the `input/` folder.
3. Open `kaggle.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```

## Results

The notebook compares multiple models and reports their accuracy. The best model can be used to generate a submission file for Kaggle.

## Credits

- [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Inspired by Kaggle kernels and the data science community
